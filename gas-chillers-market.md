<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Chillers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop</li><li>Closed Loop</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Gas chillers are widely used in industries and commercial buildings for cooling purposes. They can be categorized into two market types: open loop and closed loop systems. Open loop gas chillers utilize a continuous flow of fresh water from a natural source to absorb heat, which is then expelled into the environment. On the other hand, closed loop gas chillers recirculate the same water or refrigerant through a closed circuit, which minimizes water usage and prevents contamination. Both systems have their advantages and applications depending on the specific cooling requirements of the facility.</p></p>
