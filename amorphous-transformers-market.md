<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Amorphous Transformers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil-Immersed</li><li>Dry-Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Amorphous transformers are energy-efficient transformers widely used in the power industry. There are two major types of amorphous transformers: oil-immersed and dry-type. Oil-immersed transformers are filled with oil to cool and insulate the windings, while dry-type transformers use air or solid insulation. Both types offer benefits such as reduced energy losses, lower operating costs, and improved environmental friendliness. Oil-immersed transformers are more commonly used for higher voltage applications, while dry-type transformers are preferred for indoor installations due to their fire-resistant properties and lower maintenance requirements.</p></p>
