<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Lung Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bubble Artificial Lung</li><li>Membrane Artificial Lung</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Artificial Lung market encompasses two main types: bubble artificial lung and membrane artificial lung. Bubble artificial lungs operate by passing oxygen through a liquid and creating bubbles that diffuse the oxygen into the bloodstream. Membrane artificial lungs, on the other hand, use a thin membrane to allow oxygen transfer between the gas and the blood without the need for bubbles. Both types serve the same purpose of providing oxygenation to patients with damaged or compromised lungs.</p></p>
