<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Street Lights Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Standalone</li><li>Grid Connected</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solar street lights are becoming popular due to their energy efficiency and sustainability. There are two main types of solar street lights: standalone and grid connected. Standalone solar street lights operate independently of the grid, relying solely on solar panels to generate and store electricity for nighttime use. Grid connected solar street lights, on the other hand, are connected to the local power grid, allowing them to draw electricity from the grid when solar power is insufficient. Both types offer eco-friendly lighting solutions, but standalone lights provide greater independence while grid-connected lights offer backup power supply.</p></p>
