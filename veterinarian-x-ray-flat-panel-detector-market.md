<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Veterinarian X-Ray Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Conversion</li><li>Indirect Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Veterinary X-Ray Flat Panel Detector market consists of two types: Direct Conversion and Indirect Conversion. Direct Conversion detectors directly convert X-ray photons into electronic signals, providing better image quality and higher efficiency. They are more expensive but are preferred for their accuracy. On the other hand, Indirect Conversion detectors use scintillation crystals to convert X-ray photons into light, which is then converted into electronic signals. These detectors are cost-effective but offer lower image quality. Both types cater to the specific needs and budget of veterinary clinics and hospitals.</p></p>
