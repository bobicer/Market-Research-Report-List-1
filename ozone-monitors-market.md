<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ozone Monitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>UV Photometric</li><li>Electrochemical</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Ozone monitors are devices used to measure the concentration of ozone in the air. There are two main types of ozone monitors: UV Photometric and Electrochemical. </p><p>UV Photometric monitors use ultraviolet light to detect and measure ozone levels. These monitors work by passing air samples through a chamber where the ozone absorbs the ultraviolet light, causing a decrease in light intensity, which is then measured to determine the ozone concentration.</p><p>On the other hand, Electrochemical monitors use a chemical reaction to generate an electric current, which is proportional to the ozone concentration. By measuring this current, the ozone levels can be determined accurately.</p><p>Both types of monitors are widely used in various industries and applications to ensure the safety and air quality in indoor and outdoor environments.</p></p>
