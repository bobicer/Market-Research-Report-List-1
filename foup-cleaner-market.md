<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The FOUP Cleaner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully-Automatic FOUP Cleaner</li><li>Manual FOUP Cleaner</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The FOUP cleaner market consists of two main types: fully-automatic and manual FOUP cleaners. Fully-automatic FOUP cleaners are automated systems that are capable of cleaning FOUPs (Front Opening Unified Pods) without human intervention. These machines utilize advanced technologies to ensure efficient and thorough cleaning of FOUPs. On the other hand, manual FOUP cleaners require manual operation by an operator. These cleaners may involve simpler mechanisms and rely on manual labor to clean FOUPs effectively. Both types serve the purpose of maintaining clean and contaminant-free FOUPs utilized in the semiconductor industry.</p></p>
