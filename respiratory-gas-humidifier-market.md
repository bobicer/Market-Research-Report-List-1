<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Respiratory Gas Humidifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Type</li><li>Passive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The respiratory gas humidifier market can be categorized into active type and passive type. Active type humidifiers require a power source to function and typically use a heating element or ultrasound to generate steam or vapor for humidification. They offer precise control over humidity levels and are commonly used in hospitals and medical settings. On the other hand, passive type humidifiers do not require a power source and rely on the patient's own breathing to pass through the humidifying medium, such as a wet sponge or wick. They are often used in home-based healthcare settings.</p></p>
