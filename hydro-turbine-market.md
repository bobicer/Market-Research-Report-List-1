<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydro Turbine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Impact Turbine</li><li>Counterattack Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Hydro turbine market types include impact turbine and counterattack turbine. The impact turbine utilizes the kinetic energy of water by generating high-speed rotation through the impact force exerted by water flow on the blades. On the other hand, a counterattack turbine uses the change in water flow direction to convert water energy into mechanical energy, achieving power generation through the counteraction between water flow and blades. Both types play a crucial role in harnessing the power of water to generate renewable and sustainable electricity.</p></p>
