<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cerebral Folate Deficiency Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Leucovorin Calcium</li><li>Folic Acid</li><li>Folinic Acid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cerebral Folate Deficiency is a medical condition characterized by the inability of the brain to properly process folate. There are different types of medications available in the market to treat this condition. Leucovorin Calcium, Folic Acid, and Folinic Acid are three such medications. Leucovorin Calcium is a form of folic acid that helps the body utilize folate. Folic Acid is a synthetic form of folate that can be easily absorbed by the body. Folinic Acid is a more active form of folate that can bypass certain metabolic steps, making it effective in treating cerebral folate deficiency.</p></p>
