<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Therapy for Mucopolysaccharidosis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intravenous</li><li>ICV</li><li>Intracerebral</li><li>Intracisternal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gene Therapy for Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) is a treatment approach that aims to correct the genetic defects causing MPS. The market for gene therapy in MPS includes various types, such as Intravenous (IV), Intracerebroventricular (ICV), Intracerebral, and Intracisternal. In IV administration, the therapeutic genes are delivered directly into the bloodstream. ICV delivery involves injecting the genes into the cerebrospinal fluid within the brain's ventricles. Intracerebral involves directly injecting the genes into specific brain regions affected by MPS, while Intracisternal administration targets the cerebellomedullary cisterns for gene delivery. These different market types offer various strategies to target and treat MPS effectively.</p></p>
