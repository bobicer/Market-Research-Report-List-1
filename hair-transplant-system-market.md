FUE is a less invasive technique compared to the traditional strip harvesting method, resulting in quicker recovery and minimal scarring.</p><p>Another emerging trend in the market is the rising demand for hair transplant procedures in female patients. Women experiencing hair thinning or loss are seeking hair restoration solutions, leading to an expansion of the market beyond male patients. In addition, the availability of non-surgical hair restoration options, such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy and laser therapy, has further fueled the market growth by attracting a broader consumer base.</p><p>In conclusion, the hair transplant system market is witnessing steady growth driven by factors like increasing hair loss cases, technological advancements, and growing awareness. The market is expected to continue expanding at a CAGR of 12.7% during the forecast period, with trends like robotic-assisted procedures and rising demand from female patients driving its growth.</p></p>
