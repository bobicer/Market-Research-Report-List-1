<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Cement and Casting Materials Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bone Cast Materials</li><li>Bone Cement Materials</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bone cast materials refer to the substances used to create casts or splints for bone fractures and injuries. These materials, such as fiberglass or plaster, are applied around the affected area to immobilize and support the bone during the healing process. On the other hand, bone cement materials are used in orthopedic surgeries to anchor implants or prosthetic joints to the bone. These materials, typically made of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), provide stability and fixation. Both bone cast and cement materials play crucial roles in the treatment and recovery of bone-related conditions.</p></p>
