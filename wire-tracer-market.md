<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wire Tracer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Tracing</li><li>Passive Tracing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wire tracer market consists of two types: active tracing and passive tracing. Active tracing involves the use of a transmitter that injects a signal into the wire, allowing the receiver to detect the signal and locate the wire. This method is useful when the wire is not powered or cannot transmit a signal. On the other hand, passive tracing relies on the wire itself to create a magnetic field that can be detected by a receiver. This method is suitable for tracing live wires or cables that already have an electrical current flowing through them.</p></p>
