<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dry Scroll Vacuum Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-sided Scroll</li><li>Double-sided Scroll</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Single-sided scroll vacuum pumps and double-sided scroll vacuum pumps are two types of dry scroll vacuum pumps. Single-sided scroll pumps have one scroll compressor element, while double-sided scroll pumps have two compressor elements. Single-sided scroll pumps are simpler and quieter than double-sided ones, making them suitable for low-volume applications. On the other hand, double-sided scroll pumps provide higher pumping speeds and are more efficient, making them ideal for high-volume applications. Both types of pumps operate without the need for lubrication, making them dry and low maintenance solutions for various vacuum applications.</p></p>
