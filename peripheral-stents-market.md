<p><h1>Peripheral Stents Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Application, Regional Outlook, Competitive Strategies, And Segment Forecasts, 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Peripheral Stents Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Peripheral stents are small mesh-like tubes made of metal or polymer that are used to treat peripheral artery disease (PAD) and improve blood flow. These stents are inserted into narrowed or blocked blood vessels to keep them open and maintain proper blood circulation.</p><p>The Peripheral Stents Market is witnessing substantial growth due to the increasing prevalence of peripheral artery disease, rising geriatric population, and advancements in stent technology. Additionally, the growing demand for minimally invasive procedures and the high success rate of peripheral stenting are driving market growth.</p><p>Furthermore, the market is experiencing several trends that are shaping its growth. One such trend is the adoption of drug-eluting stents, which release medication to prevent restenosis or the re-narrowing of the blood vessels. These stents have exhibited better long-term outcomes compared to bare-metal stents, leading to their increased usage.</p><p>Another trend is the development of bioresorbable stents that gradually dissolve over time, thus eliminating the need for long-term implantation. These stents reduce the risk of stent thrombosis and offer improved patient outcomes.</p><p>Moreover, the rising focus on research and development activities by key market players to introduce innovative stent designs and materials is propelling market growth. For instance, the introduction of self-expanding stents and bioengineered stents has enhanced procedural efficacy and patient comfort.</p><p>In conclusion, the Peripheral Stents Market is expected to witness significant growth in the coming years. Factors such as the increasing prevalence of peripheral artery disease, advancements in stent technology, and the adoption of drug-eluting and bioresorbable stents are driving market growth. The market is characterized by ongoing research and development activities by key players to introduce innovative stent designs and materials, further fueling market expansion.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peripheral Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon-expandable</li><li>Self-expandable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Peripheral stents are used to treat various peripheral artery diseases and maintain the flow of blood through blocked or narrowed blood vessels. There are two main types of peripheral stents: balloon-expandable and self-expandable. Balloon-expandable stents are made of a metal scaffold that is placed in the artery and then expanded using a balloon catheter. Self-expandable stents, on the other hand, are made of a flexible material that expands on its own once deployed in the artery. Both types of stents help restore blood flow and provide support to the affected vessels.</p></p>
