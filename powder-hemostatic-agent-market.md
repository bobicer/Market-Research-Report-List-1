<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Powder Hemostatic Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Hemostatic Agent</li><li>Not Absorbable Hemostatic Agent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The powder hemostatic agent market can be divided into two types: absorbable and not absorbable hemostatic agents. Absorbable hemostatic agents are used to control bleeding during surgical procedures. They are made from biodegradable materials that the body can naturally break down and eliminate over time. Not absorbable hemostatic agents, on the other hand, are used for external bleeding control and are not designed to be absorbed by the body. They create a physical barrier or clot to stop bleeding and are usually made from inorganic materials. Both types are widely used in medical settings to promote hemostasis and prevent excessive bleeding.</p></p>
