<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Calcium Reactors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Chamber Structure</li><li>Dual Chamber Structure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Calcium Reactors market consists of two types: Single Chamber Structure and Dual Chamber Structure. </p><p>In a Single Chamber Structure reactor, the calcium, carbonate media, and acid are mixed together in one chamber, allowing for the dissolution of calcium carbonate. This type is generally simpler and more cost-effective. </p><p>On the other hand, a Dual Chamber Structure reactor separates the calcium carbonate media and acid into two chambers, which are connected by a recirculation pump. This design provides better control over the dissolution process and allows for more precise adjustments to the reactor's parameters.</p></p>
