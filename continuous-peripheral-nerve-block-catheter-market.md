<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Continuous Peripheral Nerve Block Catheter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stimulating Catheter</li><li>Non-Stimulating Catheter</li><li>Over-The-Needle Catheter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Continuous peripheral nerve block catheters are used for post-operative pain management. Stimulating catheters have electrodes at the tip that stimulates the nerve, helping to correctly position the catheter. Non-stimulating catheters do not have electrodes and are used for patients who are allergic to certain metals or are intolerant to nerve stimulation. Over-the-needle catheters are inserted through a needle into the nerve and once in place, the needle is removed, leaving the catheter in place. These different types cater to different patient needs and preferences in pain management.</p></p>
