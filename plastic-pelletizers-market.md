<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plastic Pelletizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Cut</li><li>Dry Cut</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Plastic pelletizers are machines used in the plastics industry to transform plastic materials into small, uniform pellets for further processing. Wet cut and dry cut are two types of pelletizing methods. In wet cut pelletizing, plastic material is cut using water as a lubricant and then dried. This method is preferred for heat-sensitive materials. Dry cut pelletizing, on the other hand, involves cutting the plastic material without the need for water, making it suitable for non-heat-sensitive materials. Each method has its advantages and is chosen based on specific material properties and processing requirements.</p></p>
