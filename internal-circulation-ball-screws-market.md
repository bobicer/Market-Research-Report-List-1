<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Internal Circulation Ball Screws Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Nut</li><li>Double nut</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Internal circulation ball screws are commonly used in various applications where precision and efficiency are required. There are two types of internal circulation ball screws on the market: single nut and double nut. </p><p>A single nut ball screw consists of a single nut that moves along the screw shaft as the screw rotates. This design offers less friction and backlash, making it suitable for applications that require high precision and smooth movement.</p><p>On the other hand, a double nut ball screw has two nuts that are threaded onto the screw shaft in opposite directions. This configuration increases load capacity and allows for higher axial stiffness. It is commonly used in applications where heavy loads need to be transferred with precision in both directions.</p><p>Both types of ball screws have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the application at hand.</p></p>
